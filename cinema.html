  <p>Did you know the first moving picture was actually made by French brothers? In <b>1895</b>, les <b>frères Lumières</b> presented their own machine called a <b>Cinématographe</b> to make their own little movies</p>
<p>Nowadays, French movie theaters actually have <b>the highest amount of people coming to see movies in the whole Europe</b> and most movies are partly financed by state money (through the CNC)</p>

    <p> Now that you have done the exercises, let's focus on some of the movies. </p>
    <p> All the French movies in the top ten are comedies except for <i>La Grande Illusion</i>, which is a war movie.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Let's focus on the first three movies:</b></p>
    <li><b><i>Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis</i>, Dany Boon</b>: This movie is a comedy about a man who moves to the North of France for work. The film focuses on clichés about the North of France where Dany Boon (the director and one of the main actors) is from. The movie is a huge success and manages to make 245.1 million $. <i>Fun fact!</i> You could have seen an adaptation produced by Will Smith if he had managed to write a good scenario. Indeed, Dany Boon refused 3 scenarios proposed by Will Smith before cancelling the project.</li>
    <li><b><i>Intouchables</i>, Olivier Nakache & Eric Toledano</b>: This film is a drama and a comedy. It relates an unusual friendship that develops when a street smart immigrant, is hired to take care of a quadriplegic nobleman. This movie came out in 2012 and managed to make more than 484 million $. <i>Fun fact!</i> You can actually find an american adaptation of this movie with Kevin Hart called the Upside </li>
    <li><b><i>La Grande Vadrouille</i>, Gérard Oury</b>: During World War II, two French civilians and a downed British Bomber Crew set out from Paris to escape to England but first they must avoid German troops or face them and die. Again, this movie is a comedy and a war movie with one of the most famous French actor: Louis de Funès. It came out in 1966, and is still considered a classic in France. It still managed to bring 33 million $</li>
